Graduation Admission Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

Objective:
Develop an ANN model to predict admission outcomes for graduate programs based on applicant profiles and academic credentials.

Key Activities:

Data Collection:

Gathered data on graduate admission profiles, including GRE scores, TOEFL scores, undergraduate GPA, and university ranking.
Ensured data completeness and quality for accurate modeling.
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned and standardized the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Normalized numerical features to a common scale for improved model convergence.
Feature Engineering:

Created new features such as overall academic score and research experience to enhance prediction accuracy.
Selected relevant features based on domain knowledge and correlation analysis.
Model Architecture:

Designed and implemented an ANN architecture using libraries like TensorFlow or Keras.
Configured the number of layers, neurons, activation functions, and optimization algorithms.
Model Training:

Split the data into training and validation sets to train and evaluate the model.
Utilized techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling to prevent overfitting.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Used techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess model generalization and robustness.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Tuned hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs to optimize model performance.
Conducted grid search or random search to identify the best combination of hyperparameters.
Deployment:

Deployed the final ANN model for admission prediction on new applicant data.
Created a user-friendly interface for applicants to input their profiles and receive admission likelihoods.
Insights and Recommendations:

Provided insights into the factors influencing admission outcomes.
Offered recommendations for applicants to improve their chances of admission based on model predictions.
